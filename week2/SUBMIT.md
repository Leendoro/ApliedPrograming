 I found that having additional pracice and looking over others code gave me a blueprint of what to do
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  i had issies figuring out how APIs worked, and i think that took more time away from my project
- How can you improve in the next module?
  Make things look nicer and add more fetures

# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}

This code is a simple weather forcast website using javascript to take information from a Weather track API and then show you the weather for the inputed city

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

i struggled alot with javascript in previous classes, plus ive alwasy had a small hobbie intrest in the weather as i often find myeslf staring at the forcast durring my free time, i figured i can try and merge the two into somthing id be able to use, or practice more of javascript

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

Visual studio code

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

i used javascript which is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It allows developers to add functionality, animations, real-time updates, and more to websites
